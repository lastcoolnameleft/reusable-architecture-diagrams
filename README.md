# **Reusable architecture diagrams**
## with Draw.ioÂ + VSCode + GitHub + MARP

### Presented by: Tommy Falgout

# My Goal

By end of this session you will, _not just learn about_, but be interested in using these processes and tools to help you make a bigger impact in your career.

# Agenda

- The Gift of Your Keystrokes
- Technology
- Live Demo

# Our Time Is Limited


- [Gift of Your Keystrokes by Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes)

```5.1CPW * 50WPM * 60m/hr * 6hr/s a day * 5 days/wk * 50 wks/year * 44yrs = 1,009,800,000 keystrokes left in your hands```

- Effectiveness vs. Efficiency
  - When we reply via email, we reach 1-10 people
  - If we expand reach (e.g. blog), we can increase impact
- Focus on ROI of the limited keystrokes

<!--
We've heard there are 525,600 minutes in a year.
Convert that time to keystrokes, what are you doing with them?
effectiveness - aka: impact
Makes for good connect-glitter to showcase your impact.

# diagrams.net (aka draw.io)

- Open Source Diagram Software
- Integrates with: Teams, G-Drive, Confluence, GitHub
- Import Shapes: Azure, AWS, UML
- Suports: Browser, Native App, VSCode

<!--
Under the hood, draw.io diagrams are XML
-->
--- 

# VS Code

- File Editor
- Vast plugin ecosystem
    - Including Draw.io

![bg right 90% VS Code plugin for Draw.io](img/vscode-drawio.png)

---

# GitHub

- Version Control as a Service
- Works best for text, NOT binary
- Uses Markdown for documentation

![bg left 60% GitHub Logo](https://icongr.am/octicons/mark-github.svg)

---

# MARP - Markdown Presentation

- Convert Markdown a presentation
- Use [GitHub action to update GH Pages & PDF](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/reusable-architecture-diagrams/blob/main/.github/workflows/marp-to-pages.yml)
- Example: [This repo!](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/reusable-architecture-diagrams)

# Putting It All Together

- Use Draw.io to create diagrams
- Use VSCode to create documentation
- Use Marp to present
- Use Github to store and version control

# Blog

Maximize your keystrokes!

![h:500px Example of blog](img/blog-devto.png)

<!--
Had ~800 views from this.  WAY more than the 10 people I would have reached if I had just responded.
YES, took more time.  But if you can do this consistently, it gets easier.
Builds good muscle.
